       |                 |  |          |    Syntax issues are output to the user if any.

           GQL builder

                v
         +------+------+                    GQLDocument is a 1:1 mapping of the antlr parse tree
         |             |                    It is a GraphQL AST
         | GQLDocument |                    Since the syntax is correct at this point, it can use Kotlin nullsafe
         |             |                    properties and sealed classes to better represent the data.
         +------+------+                    It also support creating/inserting new elements and writing the document
                |                           to a file

                v              v
         +------+------+  +----+-----+      At this stage, the GQLDocuments are the same as before but are validated so a
         |             |  |          |      lot more assumptions can be done later in the compiler.

     infer fragments variables

                v
         +------+-------+                   FrontendIR is easier to work with than GQLDocument as it resolves types against
         |              |                   the schema. It also interprets directive and can represent things that cannot
         |  FrontendIR  |                   be represented in pure GraphQL like boolean combinations of fields and fragments
         |              |                   arguments

                v
         +------+-------+                    BackendIR does the bulk of the work of computing
         |              |                    possibles types. It could maybe be merged with FrontendIR

   Maps GraphQL to Kotlin types
 Computes implements and override

         +------+-------+                    CodegenAST isn't bound to Kotlin but contains
         |              |                    all the structure required to map to Kotlin
         |  CodegenAST  |                    It contains more information about the type hierarchy compared to BackendIR
         |              |
